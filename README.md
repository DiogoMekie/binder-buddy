## üåü Project Overview

**BinderBuddy** is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to empower Trading Card Game (TCG) enthusiasts to meticulously track their card collections and monitor their real-time market values. Built with a robust **Spring Boot** backend and a dynamic **React** frontend, this platform aims to provide collectors with invaluable insights into their assets.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned & In Progress)

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and protected access to personal inventories.
* **Personal Card Inventory:** Add, edit, and delete TCG cards with details like game, set, condition, and quantity.
* **Real-time Card Value Tracking:** Integration with external TCG pricing APIs to display up-to-date market values. (Initially, this will likely involve polling; later, we'll explore WebSockets for true real-time updates).
* **Portfolio Overview:** A dashboard to visualize the total value of your collection and track gains/losses over time.
* **Price History & Analytics:** View historical price trends for individual cards and general collection analytics.
* **Search & Filtering:** Easily find cards within your collection or the broader TCG database.
